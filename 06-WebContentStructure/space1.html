    <h1>Milestones in space travel</h1>
    <p>The history of space travel is filled with remarkable milestones
        that have shaped our understanding of the cosmos. The first artificial
        satellite, Sputnik 1, was launched by the Soviet Union in 1957,
        marking the beginning of the space age. This event triggered
        the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union,
        which culminated in the Apollo 11 mission in 1969. During this mission,
        Neil Armstrong became the first human to set foot on the Moon,
        a moment that remains iconic to this day.

        As space exploration progressed, so did our technological capabilities.
        The development of reusable rockets by companies like SpaceX has
        revolutionized the space industry, making missions more cost-effective
        and sustainable. This breakthrough has opened up new possibilities
        for future exploration, including manned missions to Mars and beyond.
        It is an exciting time for space travel, as advancements in technology
        continue to push the boundaries of what is possible.

        Another significant milestone was the construction of the International
        Space Station (ISS), which has been continuously inhabited by astronauts
        from various countries since the year 2000. The ISS serves as a research
        laboratory in space, where experiments are conducted in microgravity
        to advance our knowledge in fields like biology, physics, and medicine.
        The collaboration between countries on this project demonstrates
        how space exploration can unite people across borders.</p>
    <h1>The Future of space exploration</h1>
    <p>The future of space exploration is filled with possibilities.
        With the rapid advancement of technology, missions to the Moon, Mars,
        and beyond are becoming more feasible. International cooperation
        will play a crucial role in achieving these ambitious goals. Space
        agencies and private companies from around the world are working together
        to push the boundaries of human knowledge and capability.

        Advances in robotics, artificial intelligence, and propulsion systems
        will be critical in overcoming the challenges of long-duration space
        travel. New propulsion technologies, such as ion engines or nuclear
        propulsion, could drastically reduce travel time to distant planets.
        Additionally, the use of AI in space exploration could help us explore
        areas that are too dangerous or remote for humans to reach, such as
        the icy moons of Jupiter or Saturn.

        Ultimately, the future of space exploration will shape humanity's destiny.
        By continuing to explore space, we will not only learn more about
        the universe but also develop new technologies that could transform life
        on Earth. The dream of exploring the stars is one of humanity's oldest
        aspirations, and with the right dedication and collaboration, it is
        a dream that may soon come true.</p>
